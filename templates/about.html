        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to JunoCity! Our team launched this platform in 2020 in an effort to help facilitate communication between different generations. 
            We believe that the strengthening of these connections will bring benefits to everyone, helping older generations stay active after retirement, 
            while provide younger generations with the opportunity to connect with knowledgeable mentors.

                JunoCity is a website where seniors and younger generations are encouraged to interact with each other,
                allowing those with more experience to share the lessons they have learned, and give advice to those with 
                less experience. People of all ages are welcome to post questions or stories in communities called <b>blocks</b>,
                where each block represents a distinct aspect of life. Anyone can answer or comment on posts, and are also 
                welcome to develop even deeper relationships through a private messaging inbox. We wish to give our senior citizens
                the ability to share the lessons and stories they have gained throughout the years, while providing value to those
                who need it.

            <p><b>What are blocks?</b></p><br>
            <p>
                Blocks are forums that focus on distinct aspects of life (i.e. Financial Block, Relationships Block). 
                Anyone is welcome to post in a particular block, but you can also choose to <b>join</b> a block, which
                will bring posts from that particular block directly to your homepage. Block <b>populations</b> are simply
                the number of people in that block. Junocity has 6 official blocks so far: <b>Financial, Retirement, Health, 
                Career, Life Lessons & Stories, and Relationships.</b> We are planning to allow users to add their own blocks
                as our community grows.

            <p><b>What are posts?</b></p><br>
            <p>
                Everyone with an account is permitted to post on Junocity. You are welcome to post questions, ask for advice,
                and tell stories through posts.

            <p><b>What are neighbors?</b></p>
            <p>
                Neighbors can be your friends and/or people you enjoy seeing posts from. You and your neighbors
                put together are considered <b>Your Block</b>. This personal block of yours is your very own personally
                built community, and you'll be able to see all of your neighbors' posts on your homepage.<br>
            </p><br>
            <p><b>What are bookmarks?</b></p>
            <p>
                Bookmark icons look like <img class="bookmark-icon" src="{% static 'img/bookmark.svg' %}" alt="bookmarks"> . For each post, you can click on this icon and it will bookmark/save the post
                to your bookmarks list. <b>Your Bookmarks</b> can be found in your profile page, right beside the settings icon. There, you will be able to see all the posts you have saved.
